## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

-Making use of gap in flexbox instead of margin and padding

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    gap: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

Having struggled quite a bit with flexbox layout, I'm planning to dive deeper into flexbox and grid system in future projects. Scaling svgs alongside of its container proved to be challenging too, and lastly I will properly learn about media query techniques as it's one of my shortcomings from this project
